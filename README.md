# BadgeFactory
Clicker Android game

Clicker game - Badge Factory. The player creates badges by clicking on the screen. He can buy additional enhancements that automate and speed up the process.
Significant progress will increase. Every five levels, a gold badge appears, which must be created for a limited time, otherwise, the player will roll back one level.
In this case, the player can turn on the farming mode (he will stay at the same level and earn money to improve the click power, buy a new improvement or improve the purchased one) and then try again to try to create a golden badge. There is also a progress reset system that unlocks at level 75. For each boss killed, the player receives a percentage to increase click power and improvements. When the moment comes when the player can no longer advance in the level, he can reset the progress and get the accumulated percentage to the strengthening.
With each purchase of improvement, its icon will appear on a special panel. Also, each improvement has the improvements that will enhance it by a certain percentage (from 100% to 250%).
